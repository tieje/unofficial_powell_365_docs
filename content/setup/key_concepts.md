## Overview

&emsp; The following are concepts that are very important to keep in mind when working with Powell.

## Avoid Making Manual Changes from the SharePoint Site

&emsp; Unless you know what you're doing, I discourage making changes directly on the SharePoint site using Powell's Edit button. Even if the desired results are achieved, the resulting behavior between Powell Manager and manual edits directly on SharePoint is unpredictable, thus making it more difficult to change in the future. Second, there is always the possibility that manual changes that are made directly on the SharePoint Site get erased by a sync. It is very easy to erase manual changes accidentally with a single *erase manual changes* checkbox when performing a sync. Edit the web UI as much as you can from Powell Manager.
