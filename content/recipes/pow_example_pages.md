## Powell Example Web Pages

&emsp; There exists a [sample Powell SharePoint site](https://pow365.sharepoint.com/sites/multilingualconnect/en-US/) with several examples of Powell webparts. You can request access [here](https://support.powell-software.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). The site templates of the sample site can be accessed through Powell Manager and going to [Powell site collections](/actions/common/#powell-intranet-powell-site-collections).

### What We Are Making

&emsp; We will be making a water fountain page, which can be found in the Powell example site [here](https://pow365.sharepoint.com/sites/multilingualconnect/en-US/waterfountain). Official [powell documentation on the Water Fountain page](https://support.powell-software.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021195020--standalone-template-Water-Fountain#h_01FTAX98H2Q296M9N631SRYFN7) exists. Additionally, [powell documentation on how to create a category on the Water Fountain page](https://support.powell-software.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021248439#-site-members-create-a-category-on-the-waterfountain-page-0-0) exists as well. Normally, we would implement the webparts ourselves, but in this case **the only way to implement the water fountain page is to clone the Powell water fountain site template**.


1. Clone the Water Fountain Powell Site Template.
2. Create a subsite or a new site collection.
