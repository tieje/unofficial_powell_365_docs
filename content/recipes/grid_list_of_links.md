## What We Are Making

&emsp; A list of accessible links is one of the most commonly requested requirements that clients ask for in SharePoint sites. To create this grid style list of links with icons, perform the following steps.

## In Powell Manager

### Create a Custom Content Type

&emsp;

1. [Go to content types](/a/a/#powell-intranet-content-types)

### Create a List Template

&emsp; In Powell Manager, the list template is used by the web part widget. If you already have this list template, then you can skip this section.

1. [Go to list templates](/a/a/#powell-intranet-list-templates)
2. *Create a new list template*
3. Fill in *Title*
4. *Select a list template model to inherit from* dropdown, select *Generic List*
5. *Add a new content type*
6. 

### Create new List from List Template

&emsp; You'll want to click through the following in Powell Manager:

1. [Get to your site](/a/a/#powell-intranet-your-site)
2. *Lists* (left sidebar)
3. *Create a new list*
4. Fill in *Title*
5. Under *Select a list model* dropdown, select *Quick Access*
6. 

### Add to Site Template

&emsp; You'll want to click through the following in Powell Manager:

1. [Get to your site](/a/a/#powell-intranet-your-site)
2. Pages on the left column
3. Edit button for the page that you want to edit
4. Scroll to the bottom: `Add a webpart`
   - If you need to add a space on your site for the web part, edit the template under the `Selected Page Layout` 
5.  Use the `Graph` web part
6. Scroll down to `Display`
7. `Select a widget view`
8. Use the `Application Tiles` widget
