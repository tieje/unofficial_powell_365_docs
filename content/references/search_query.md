The language used in this particular search box is [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference). KQL is used to build search queries for the SharePoint search service. For syntax and more, please refer to documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/building-search-queries-in-sharepoint). These search queries allow developers to query the SharePoint site, often times for looking for info in site contents.
