## Content Types
&emsp; A *Content Type* is the type of content allowed in a *List Template*. *List Templates* can be composed of several *Content Type*. A *Content Type* is composed of one or more *Types*. Although there are technically three types of content types according to Powell, in my experience, there are really only two kinds: standard *Content Type* and custom *Content Type*. 

## Standard Content Types
&emsp; Content types that come with Powell.

## Partner's Content Types
&emsp; Custom content types that have been made by your business entity.

## Custom Content Types
&emsp; Custom content types that have been made by your SharePoint tenant.
