## Purpose

&emsp; Because Powell is low-code/no-code solution, it requires what some call may *tribal knowledge*. This section contains justifications and guides of why things should be done a certain way and how to do them in Powell.

## Note to Contributors

&emsp; For contributors, this section should be referenced often for why things are done a certain way.

## Problem Solving Methods

### For Building Web Components

1. Understand the Webpart and, if needed, the Display widget that you are using.
   - [Not all webparts use a custom Display widget](/references/webparts/#display-or-select-widget).
   - Which field types will the Display widget need?
2. Create the content type.
3. Create the list template.
4. Create the list.
5. Add the webpart.
6. Save and Sync.

If you have any questions, reach out to Powell Support ASAP. They will probably answer on the same day, but it may take a day or two for them to set up a meeting.
