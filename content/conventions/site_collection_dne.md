### Problem

&emsp; We need to create a site collection for the client, but the client does not have a site collection for us to work with yet on their Powell tenant and we do not have permission to create a site collection on their SharePoint tenant.

### Solution
&emsp; The best practice is to ask Powell to transfer the client's Powell tenant to our master tenant. Later, when the client gives us their SharePoint tenant site, we can change the tenant URL domain for the tenant that we created and ask Powell to give the client permissions to the tenant.
