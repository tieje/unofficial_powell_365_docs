# Unofficial Powell 365 Documentation

---

## Motivation

&emsp; The purpose of this documentation is to ease the developer experience of Powell 365. As of this writing (2023/01/19), [official Powell documentation](https://support.powell-software.com/hc/en-us) is less than helpful. While [official training videos](https://www.youtube.com/@powellsoftware6848/videos) do exist:
- [building a theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JvbDpHYCmo)
- [site collection deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyMBqLUxXfA)
- [Powell apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_RZ8Rxpwcw)

as well as a [learning center](https://pow365.sharepoint.com/sites/learningcenter) [(email Powell for access)](https://support.powell-software.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001285619), this form of training is not especially helpful for developers building SharePoint sites using Powell. Due to lack-luster documentation, this documentation was born to help developers be productive.
